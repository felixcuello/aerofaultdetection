* Aero Fault Detection

** Introduction
This is an AI/ML project to detect faulty sensors on wind turbines.

** Setup
Everything is set up inside the `Makefile`. So you have to look inside that file for the options.

First copy the `.env.sample` into the `.env` and adjust all the environment variables (*DO NOT LEAVE THE DEFAULTS*).

*** Database

The most common options are:

- `make db_up` : To start the database

- `make db_create` : To create the database tables (after the container was started)

- `make db_delete` : To delete the database tables (after the container was created)

- `make psql` : To access a psql command inside the DB container

*** Application

- `make testshell` : To get a bash shell inside the application container
