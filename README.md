# Introduction

The following code is the implementation of I paper I wrote in December 2023,
where we were trying to identify anomalies in a time series CSV get from a
SCADA.

The idea is to identify automatically errors in timeseries.

The steps are written as comments in the code, but the investigation and
justification about this is writen in a separate paper that was delivered
along with this software.
